Appathon
========

Tap on the left or right side of the screen to move your avatar left and right, the blue blocks are good, green are better and red are bad. The blocks speed up and pulse along with the music and the level transforms for certain parts of the song.

This game, named Sound Invaders, was created by Team Lemon Slice for the 2014 Mubaloo Appathon held at the University of Bristol. We had 26 hours to create this app from the ground up. Sound Invaders was made using the jPCT library for Android. We only decided to create Sound Invaders on the morning of the Appathon so there was little planning and the code is incredibly messy.

The App has been tested on Android 4.1.2 and 4.4. It should work on 4.0 and up but we haven't tested it on those platforms.

If you are interested in other work by Team Lemon Slice please take a look at BrainSlice, another Android App that we had considerably more time to plan and implement:

This repository is not currently public, but will be after the 2nd of May (pending delays and extensions).
